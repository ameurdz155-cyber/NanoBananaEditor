## 7. Tips & Best Practices

### 7.1 Writing Effective Prompts

#### ✅ DO's

**Be Specific and Descriptive**
- ❌ Bad: `"a cat"`
- ✅ Good: `"a fluffy orange tabby cat sitting on a windowsill, soft morning light, cozy atmosphere"`

**Include Artistic Direction**
- ❌ Bad: `"a landscape"`
- ✅ Good: `"a landscape painting in impressionist style, vibrant colors, loose brushstrokes, inspired by Monet"`

**Specify Technical Details**
- ❌ Bad: `"a photo of a building"`
- ✅ Good: `"architectural photography of a modern glass building, wide-angle lens, golden hour lighting, professional composition"`

**Use Quality Modifiers**
- Add terms like: "high quality", "detailed", "professional", "4K", "masterpiece"
- Example: `"high quality digital art, highly detailed, professional illustration"`

**[📸 Screenshot Placeholder: Side-by-side comparison of simple vs detailed prompt results]**

#### ❌ DON'Ts

**Avoid Ambiguity**
- Don't use vague terms without context
- Specify what style, mood, or quality you want

**Don't Overload with Contradictions**
- ❌ Bad: `"realistic cartoon photorealistic painting"`
- ✅ Good: Choose one style and stick with it

**Don't Use Copyrighted Characters**
- Avoid specific movie characters, brand mascots
- Use generic descriptions instead

**Don't Expect Perfection Immediately**
- First generation may need refinement
- Use Edit mode to adjust results

### 7.2 Optimal Settings for Different Use Cases

#### For Photorealistic Images
- **Temperature:** 0.2 - 0.4
- **Prompt Style:** Technical photography terms
- **Keywords:** "photorealistic, high detail, professional photography, sharp focus"

**[📸 Screenshot Placeholder: Settings panel for photorealistic generation]**

#### For Artistic/Creative Images
- **Temperature:** 0.6 - 0.9
- **Prompt Style:** Artistic terms, style references
- **Keywords:** "artistic, creative, imaginative, expressive, stylized"

**[📸 Screenshot Placeholder: Settings panel for artistic generation]**

#### For Consistent Characters/Objects
- **Temperature:** 0.3 - 0.5
- **Use Seed:** Same seed number for variations
- **Reference Images:** Upload character design reference

**[📸 Screenshot Placeholder: Character consistency examples with same seed]**

#### For Experimental/Abstract Art
- **Temperature:** 0.8 - 1.0
- **Prompt Style:** Abstract concepts, emotions
- **Keywords:** "abstract, surreal, experimental, unconventional"

**[📸 Screenshot Placeholder: Abstract art examples]**

### 7.3 Masking Best Practices

**Start with Larger Brush**
- Use 60-80px for initial coverage
- Switch to smaller brush (20-30px) for edges

**Zoom In for Precision**
- Zoom to 150-200% for detailed work
- Use smaller brush sizes at high zoom

**Slightly Overlap Boundaries**
- Extend mask slightly beyond target area
- Ensures clean edges in final result

**Use Feathered Edges**
- Don't make razor-sharp mask lines
- Slight blur creates natural blending

**Preview Without Mask**
- Toggle mask visibility frequently
- Verify selection accuracy

**[📸 Screenshot Placeholder: Step-by-step masking technique demonstration]**

### 7.4 Performance Optimization

**Manage History Size**
- Clear old history periodically
- Export important images before clearing
- Keeps app running smoothly

**Close Unused Panels**
- Hide prompt panel when not needed
- Hide history panel to maximize canvas space
- Use keyboard shortcuts for quick access

**Use Appropriate Image Sizes**
- Reference images don't need to be huge
- Resize large reference images before upload
- Reduces processing time

**Monitor API Usage**
- Check your API quota regularly
- Free tier: 1,500 requests per day
- Upgrade if you need more

A: 
- **Generation Output:** PNG (1024x1024, high quality)
- **Reference Upload:** JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF
- **Export:** PNG, JPG (user choice)

---

**Q: How many images can I generate per day?**

A: With the free Gemini API tier, you can generate up to 1,500 images per day. This limit resets daily.

---

### Technical Questions

**Q: What AI model does this use?**

A: AI Image Studio Pro uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash with Imagen 3 for image generation and editing. This is Google's latest and most advanced multimodal AI model.

---

**Q: Can I use my own OpenAI or Stable Diffusion API?**

A: Currently, only Google Gemini API is supported. Future versions may include additional model support based on user demand.

---

**Q: Why does SynthID watermark my images?**

A: Google embeds an invisible SynthID watermark in all AI-generated images. This helps identify AI-created content and combat misinformation. It doesn't affect image quality or visibility.

---

**Q: Can I remove the watermark?**

A: The SynthID watermark is embedded by Google's API and cannot be disabled. It's invisible to the human eye and doesn't affect printing or display quality.

---

**Q: What's the maximum prompt length?**

A: You can write prompts up to 1000+ characters. However, most effective prompts are 50-200 characters. Longer isn't always better.

---

### Feature Questions

**Q: Can I generate images larger than 1024x1024?**

A: Currently, the Gemini API outputs 1024x1024 images. We're exploring upscaling features for future versions.

---

**Q: Can I batch generate multiple images?**

A: Batch generation is planned for version 2.1. Currently, you can generate images sequentially and they're saved to history.

---

**Q: How do I create consistent characters?**

A: Use the same seed number across generations and include reference images of your character. Keep core description consistent while varying actions/poses.

---

**Q: Can I edit images not created by this app?**

A: Yes! Upload any image to the canvas (drag & drop or paste), then use Edit or Mask modes to modify it.

---

**Q: Is there a mobile version?**

A: Currently desktop-only (Windows, macOS, Linux). Mobile companion app is planned for version 3.0.

---

### Workflow Questions

**Q: How do I create variations of the same image?**

A: Keep the same seed number and adjust only temperature or minor prompt details. Or use Edit mode on the existing image.

---

**Q: Can I undo a generation?**

A: Generations can't be undone, but your history saves all previous versions. Click any thumbnail to restore that version.

---

**Q: How do I compare two generated images?**

A: Use the History panel to click between thumbnails. The canvas updates instantly for quick comparison.

---

**Q: Can I export my entire history?**

A: Yes! In History panel, click "Export All" to save all images with metadata to a folder.

---

**Q: How do I share my templates?**

A: Go to Templates → Manage → Export. This creates a JSON file you can share. Others can import it into their app.

---

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: Why do my images look blurry?**

A: Check your prompt includes quality keywords like "high detail", "sharp focus", "professional". Also ensure Temperature isn't too high (keep under 0.7).

---

**Q: Why does the app say "Rate Limit Exceeded"?**

A: You've hit the daily API limit (1,500 requests on free tier). Wait until the next day (resets at midnight UTC) or upgrade your API plan.

---

**Q: Can I recover deleted history?**

A: No, clearing history is permanent. Always export important images before clearing history.

---

**Q: Why aren't my keyboard shortcuts working?**

A: Ensure no modal windows are open and the canvas has focus. Click on the canvas area first, then try shortcuts.
